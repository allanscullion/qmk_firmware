  * Made the right-hand quote key double as Cmd/Win on hold. So you get ' when you tap it, " when you tap it with Shift, and Cmd or Win when you hold it. You can then use it as a modifier, or just press and hold it for a moment (and then let go) to send a single Cmd or Win keystroke (handy for opening the Start menu on Windows).

This is what we ship with out of the factory. :) The image says it all:
